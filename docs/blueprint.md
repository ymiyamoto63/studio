# **App Name**: Personal Color Analyzer

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Allow users to upload an image for color analysis.
- Image Display & Selection: Display the uploaded image and a color picker tool for pixel selection.
- Color Analysis & Personal Color Detection: Identify the RGB, hex code, and closest color name of a selected pixel. Determine the corresponding personal color (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) based on predefined color palettes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light, neutral background (e.g., #F5F5F5) to ensure the image and color analysis results are the focus.
- Secondary color: A clean, dark gray (e.g., #333333) for text and important UI elements.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements like buttons and highlights, providing a sense of sophistication and trust.
- A clean and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The image should be prominently displayed, with the color analysis results clearly presented below or to the side.
- Use simple and recognizable icons to represent actions like uploading, analyzing, and displaying results. The icons should be consistent with the overall clean aesthetic.
